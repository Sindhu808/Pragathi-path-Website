Prepare Mulberry Garden: Plant mulberry cuttings or seeds in well-prepared soil. Prune regularly to encourage leaf growth.
Purchase Healthy Silkworm Eggs: Buy from a reputable breeder or government sericulture department. Eggs should be disease-free.
Incubate and Hatch Silkworm Eggs: Keep eggs in a clean, controlled environment until they hatch (about 10-12 days).
Rear Silkworms (Feeding and Care): Feed fresh, clean mulberry leaves several times a day. Use leaves from 5th instar onwards.
Mounting for Cocoon Formation: After the 5th instar (about 6 weeks), silkworms stop eating and search for a place to spin cocoons. Provide 'mountages'.
Harvesting Cocoons: Cocoons are ready to harvest 6 days after mounting. Harvest during cool hours. Gently remove cocoons without damaging the pupae.
Post-Harvest Cocoon Handling: Kill the pupa inside the cocoon by heating (boiling or oven-drying) before reeling to prevent moth emergence.
Silk Reeling (Optional): Cook cocoons in hot water to soften sericin. Reel the continuous silk filaments onto reels.
Quick Tips: Maintain cleanliness and hygiene. Monitor temperature and humidity. Use only fresh, clean mulberry leaves.
