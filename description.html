    "Prepare Mulberry Garden: Plant mulberry cuttings or seeds in well-prepared soil. Prune regularly to encourage new leaf growth. Harvest leaves in the morning and keep them fresh by covering with a wet cloth during transport and storage.",
    "Purchase Healthy Silkworm Eggs: Buy from a reputable breeder or government sericulture department. Eggs should be healthy and disease-free, and suitable for your region's climate.",
    "Incubate and Hatch Silkworm Eggs: Keep eggs in a clean, controlled environment until they hatch (about 10–14 days). Eggs hatch into larvae (caterpillars), which are then ready for feeding.",
    "Rear Silkworms (Feeding and Care): Feed fresh, clean mulberry leaves several times a day. Use leaves from 55–65 day-old shoots for late-stage silkworms. Maintain temperature (22–24°C) and humidity (60–65%) in the rearing room. Silkworms molt four times over 4–6 weeks. Increase leaf quantity as they grow.",
    "Mounting for Cocoon Formation: After the 5th instar (about 6 weeks), silkworms stop eating and search for a place to spin cocoons. Collect mature larvae and place them on mountages. Avoid overcrowding.",
    "Harvesting Cocoons: Cocoons are ready to harvest 6 days after mounting. Harvest during cool hours. Gently remove cocoons from mountages. Remove defective cocoons and grade by size and quality.",
    "Post-Harvest Cocoon Handling: Kill the pupa inside the cocoon by heating (boiling or oven-drying) before it breaks the silk thread. Pack cocoons loosely in netted bags and transport during cool hours.",
    "Silk Reeling (Optional): Cook cocoons in hot water to soften sericin. Brush and unwind silk filaments onto reels. Further steps include re-reeling, twisting, dyeing, and weaving.",
    "Quick Tips: Maintain cleanliness and hygiene. Monitor temperature and humidity. Use only fresh, clean mulberry leaves. Avoid overcrowding. Join local sericulture training or government programs."
